- <Eth|cal> sometimes critters flicker between white and normal colour in the critterview

- Window Headers as in F1 window

- default settings for brainview

- check all settings

- remove 1 pixel spacer in crittervision!

- turn sun at roundworld

- killhalf settings to F12, make % population_eliminate_limt

- option to allow multiple connections / plane

- test crash & limits of 2.5 million+ synapses / critter when opening brainview

- field of view broken

- fpslimit stopped working? 


beta13.1
--------

X bzip compression on critters

X disabled testworld & concaveworld

X OpenMP is now optional

X fix make install

X removed obsolete libusb dependency

X fix: autoexchange segfault

X boost linking fix

beta13
------

X selfcollisions & camera precision in f6 window

X fix/disable autoexchange

X optimise, make theaded & fix brainview further

X make bullet static

X changed decreasing energy by percentage to the unit

X activate food when map changes

X cost / bodypart

X mutationrate : more precise

X rejuvenate like 25%

X adapt F1 panel

X test dying critter on constraint

X segfault when duplicating critters

X retina of critters : 2048 x 2048 atm, do like cd2
  retinasperrow in worldb ???

X optimise neuroninterz process (cachegrind)

X when switching fs, reposition the hud

X pixel offset in the hud

X adjust brain weights for more synapses

X braincosts & bodycosts, smaller influence

X lighting & colors

X food count reporting fix

X fix freeEnergy floating point drift

X speciesview is not accurate, wrong color with wrong number of neurons

X if the SEEN critter  (by critter) is of the same species, differentiate by alpha

X threads in other modes

X simply do not insert food if > critters kill limit

X critters can now see if other critters are of the same species
